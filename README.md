## My process

The process for this exercise consisted of:
- Understanding what was asked: an interactive page for both desktop and mobile.
- A structured approach of the HTML code.
- A CSS styling using custom properties and flexbox.
- Once I was satisfied with how the page looked, I added a temporary "Main Page" html file to the button, to make everything cleaner.
- Inspected the page to confirm everything was as clean as possible, and submitted.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned a lot about proper spacing of elements, I had to play around with positions and margins to make everything look nice.

### Continued development

I would like to get a better understanding of interactive CSS, so I can make cleaner and prettier code. For this project I would have liked to have the scarecrow image move, to make it more interactive. I am aware that I can use :hover in css, but I am unsure as to how to apply this.
